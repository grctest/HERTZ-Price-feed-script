# HERTZ

## Price feed script for the [HERTZ](https://cryptofresh.com/a/HERTZ) asset, issued on the Bitshares DEX!

Hertz is a Formula Based Asset (FBA) which is pegged against the [USD|XDR] and modified to oscillate between rising the price feed and decreasing it in a predictable manner, thus we create phases of buying and selling pressure constantly back and forth forever.

## Dependences:
